This program was developed for Network Defense and CTF competition. 
    Syntax use
    
    -h (help menu)
    -u (keep services up requires the Name of the service and not the Caption) example autosvcrst -u Apache2.4,mysql,vsftpd
    -s (keep services down requires the Name of the service and not the Caption) example autosvcrst -u Apache2.4,mysql,vsftpd
    -l (list all running services) example: autosvcrst -l stop or autosvcrst -l start
    * compile version will by <programName.exe>
